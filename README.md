# 96_well_R_Code
Code used to analyze absorbance data from 96 well plates
This is code that I'm using to examine biofilm resistance to antifungals.
Please cite this code if you're using it. 

IMPORTANT
Data must be set up in 2 columns in Excel so it can be read and easily plotted in ggplots, this also allows for ANOVA tests to be performed

BiofilmCode, GrowthCurve, and Heatmap are main programs. Sample in and ourputs are provided
